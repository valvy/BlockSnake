# BlockSnake
A project to test my skills in game engine programming. 
Instead of using a lot of third party libraries I decided to program everything within reason myself. (such as the math library and load bmp textures)

It's written in Opengl c++11 and for gnu/linux Xlib/glew and for apple cocoa.

(this was not to make a fun game, but to learn the basics of game engine programming)
